Everyone's path to science differentiate slightly. 
Some follow it as an idealistic passion since the start of their career in academia while others stumble into it and found their path in science later in life.
Then, there are also those like me who are interested in seeing the future that could be hinted in science fiction so why not work in it.

I could remember the sense of wonder and excitement of the scale of the unknown through the episodic format of Babylon 5 during my childhood.
While I was too young to appreciate the political nature of the story, it was my first introduction to space opera that went beyond a simple hero story.

Babylon 5 was an inspiration to a possible future where humanity demonstrated the will and ability to reach beyond our yellow star.
There was plenty of challenges along the way but the Earth and its colonies were united. 
During a time of much worldwide geopolitical turbulent in the 1990s, it provided a powerful message of hope.

While science fiction often carry an idealistic message, the actual components that made up the science of the fictions are often the draw.
Among the many works I have seen, one of the themes that I have found the most fascinating is the development of technology for digitization of consciousness that can keep one living virtually forever.

While the concept of algorithms and patterns is not foreign in science, one that is of the human mind has always been an enticing mystery to science.
If one can have a technology to create a digital mind from one own mind, would that digital mind be you, part of you, or another you?

In Old Man's War by John Scalzi, the elderly are offered a chance to volunteer to become soldiers of the Colonial Defense Force. 
If accepted, your mind would be transferred into a new body, much younger and more powerful than they have ever had to serve with a promise that once they finish their tour, they would be given a new live with a young body again.

The same concept of mind transference could be found in The Commonwealth Saga by Peter F. Hamilton in which a mind could be digitally record onto a neuro implant.
This process enable one to transfer their mind into a new clone body.

These ideas of the possibility of immortality present a certain challenge to our society as a whole. 
Since the start of the civilization, we have seen

The concept of continuity of the mind in the world of digital consciousness is a complex matter.
